Upcharge

Change the world -- change yourself

Upcharge is a platform that connects location independent professionals and local schools, 
orphanages, non-profits, and charities. Charities provide accommodation and access to internet. 
Freelancers devote a pre-arranged amount of time to teaching children or staff English, 
Computer Science, Critical Thinking, or other universally applicable life skills.

Time commitment is agreed upon on a case by case basis depending on the needs of the non-profit 
and the availability of the freelancer, but the general expectation is that freelancers can 
remain focused on their remote work.
