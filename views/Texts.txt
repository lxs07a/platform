About Us

Upcharge is a platform that connects location independent professionals 
and local non-profits and charities, such as orphanages and schools. 
Charities provide accommodation and access to internet. 
Freelancers devote a pre-arranged amount of time to teaching 
children or staff English, Computer Science, Critical Thinking, 
or other universally applicable life skills. 

Time commitment is agreed upon on a case by case basis depending 
on the needs of the non-profit and the availability of the freelancer,
but the general expectation is that freelancers 
can remain focused on their remote work.
